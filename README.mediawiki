== User Guide ==

=== Quick Start ===

The easiest to start right away is to use the provided maven archetype plugin.

Just run (you will need maven 3+)

 mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=asamal-quickstart -DarchetypeGroupId=pl.softwaremill.asamal -DarchetypeVersion=1-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeRepository=http://tools.softwaremill.pl/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/

Open you generated pom.xml, and change ${asamal.version} (will dissapear soon) to 1-SNAPSHOT

and then run mvn install - this will produce a war, which you will be able to deploy on JBoss 7.x (just copy to ${JBOSS_HOME}/standalone/deployments )
